Portal 2 is one of my favourite games. From the levels to the music, the atmosphere is on point for me. <p>
The comedy that is almost hidden in the environment shows how much care was put into every detail. <p>
One of these details is the posters you find in the "Old Aperture" section of the game. <p>

I needed some interesting things I could put on my walls, and I remembered these posters. <p>
So I opened [VPKEdit](https://github.com/craftablescience/VPKEdit), to try and get the textures directly from the game;<p>

But they were all so low resolution! I should have seen it coming (but sometimes I forget this game is from 2011 :P) <p>
And so, I set out to recreate it, at a much higher resolution, in [GIMP](https://gimp.org)! <p>
The background was made using a fill tool and colour picker from the original. <p>

Next was more simple elements including the underline of "*Remember!*", and the arrow pointing to the portal. <p>

Then, using trial and error, plus a lot of font guessing, I recreated the text. <p>

A detail I forgot was the "Aperture Science Innovators" logo, which I changed to blue for added contrast. <p>
<img src="sign_logo.jpg" style="width: 30%;"> <p>
Up next was the portal, which I copied the colour from the original and traced it using the path tool. <p>
<img src="sign_portal.jpg" style="width: 30%;"> <p>
Then, one of the final things, the person and their portal device. This was made using the same technique, doing both colours seperately! <p>

Last (and maybe least) is the grime and dirt on top of the image, this was just copying dirt textures from the internet and overlaying them! <p>
Here is the final, but not full resolution (because I downscaled it so it wouldn't use too much bandwith) result! <p>
